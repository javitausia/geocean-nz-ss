Most of the tidal gauge data in this folder was handed to Seb in the form of text files or spreasheets that was then packed in NetCDF4 format and is stored in the **raw** folder.

That data is only to be used for the purpose of this project. Details on the data owner can be found in the spreasheet in the sharepoint folder of the project. Some info is also in the attributes of the NetCDF files.

The raw data in the **raw** folder is in various states depending on the location and will require proper QC before being used. The resolution of the data is variable and generally varies in resolution over the life of the dataset which means it will also need resampling. Datum is generally mean sea level and time was converted to UTC as part of the packing process.

The **processed** folder will contain the processed data when processing has been done.
