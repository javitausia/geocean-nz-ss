** here goes the CFSR pressure ... **

still trying to compress super-BIG files...

**CFSR_MSLP_daily.nc**: This is the MSLP data, daily resampled, and used in the project for the daily experiments, downloaded from [here (v1)](https://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/ds093.1/).
**CFSR_WINDs_uv_daily.nc**: These are the WINDs data, daily resampled, and used in the project for the daily experiments, downloaded from [here (v1)](https://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/ds093.1/).
cfsr_mapsta.nc: This is New Zealand land, used when projected winds are calculated!!
CFSR_MSLP_1Dmin_2020_2021_play.nc: This is a play dataset to see how the MSLP in the CFSR data must be stored
CFSR_winds_1Dmax_2020_2021_play.nc: This is a play dataset to see how the WINDs in the CFSR data must be stored

**CFSR data** is preferred in this project!!

The used dataset (v1) can be accessed [here](https://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/ds093.1/):
