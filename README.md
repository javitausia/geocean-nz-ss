## 4. Installation

### 4.1 Create an environment in conda

To run the toolbox you first need to install the required Python packages in an environment. To do this we will see **Anaconda**, which can be downloaded freely [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).

Once you have installed it on your PC, open the Anaconda prompt (in Mac and Linux, open a terminal window) and use the `cd` command to go to the folder where you have cloned this repository.

Create a new environment named `ssnz` with all the required packages:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

### 4.2 Activate conda environment

All the required packages have been now installed in an environment called `ssnz`. Now, activate this new environment:

```
conda activate ssnz
```
