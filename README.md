## Description

Storm surge is the rise of water level generated by wind and atmospheric pressure changes associated with tropical or
extra-tropical storms, over and above the astronomical tide (AT). Storm surge is one of the most critical components of
coastal flooding and its magnitude has a large spatial variability. Flooding associated with storm surges is one of the
most common natural hazards for coastal areas worldwide (Cagigal et al., 2019) ...

In this project, which is a collaboration project between the University of Cantabria (Spain) and Metservice (New Zealand), 
we will develop different machine learning tools that might help in the forecast of a storm-surge model ...

## Data explanation

Different datasets will be used in the project, but all of them belongs to one of these categories:
* Sea-level-pressure fields, which can be the ERA5 or the CFSR reanalysis
* Storm surge hindcast data, which can be Moana, DAC, CoDEC...
* Storm surge real observations, where different datasets / organizations are involved!!

## Installation

### Create an environment in conda

To run the toolbox you first need to install the required Python packages in an environment. To do this we will see **Anaconda**, which can be downloaded freely [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).

Once you have installed it on your PC, open the Anaconda prompt (in Mac and Linux, open a terminal window) and use the `cd` command to go to the folder where you have cloned this repository.

Create a new environment named `ssnz` with all the required packages:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

### Activate conda environment

All the required packages have been now installed in an environment called `ssnz`. Now, activate this new environment:

```
conda activate ssnz
```

## Additional support:
